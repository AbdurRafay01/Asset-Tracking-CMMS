				<h3> What is Asset Tracking ?</h3>

					When working on a global platform. There is always a need for a management system that automates your work and allows you to control, manage and monitor various aspects of your organization. There is no proper system to check or track assets that are being utilized in your organization or are in use of particular labour. Similarly, labour tracking is also hard to track. It would be better if the system is automated and live tracking is enabled for both functions. These services include indoor navigation for people, the machinery inside organizations or educational institutions, asset tracking, location of patients inside a hospital. These types of services are also becoming a need of gigantic logistics or warehouse-based companies where there is a need for parcels or vehicle tracking.
                        Generating work reports is also a challenging task if there is no proper monitoring on time. So, to cater to this problem, we've brought up a solution in which smart tags will use which will be attached to the asset which will be providing real-time tracking of that particular asset or labour through routers and that router will be providing the data to the server system where the system will be providing the current location of that particular asset.

				<h3> What is geofencing ?</h3>

			<div class="answer">
				<p>
					Geofencing is a location-based service in which an app or other software uses GPS, RFID, Wi-Fi or cellular data to trigger a pre-programmed action when a mobile device or RFID tag enters or exits a virtual boundary set up around a geographical location, known as a geofence.

				<h3> How does geofencing works with asset tracking ?</h3>

			</div>
			<div class="answer">
				<p>
					Geofencing works by creating a virtual perimeter or boundary around a real location via GPS tracking technology. Then, whenever your tagged vehicle or asset enters or leaves those virtual boundaries, an alert is sent.
